# About the diagrams

The diagrams are created using PlantUML (https://plantuml.com/) which is a 
description language for the most common UML diagram types.

Reusable fragments are stored in the corresponding subfolders (e.g. classes in 
the classes folder, etc.) and have the '.iuml' extension. These fragments are 
then included in the 'real' diagrams which are stored in this folder and have 
the '.puml' extension. The generated diagram images are stored in the 'output' 
folder as both .png and .svg files.

For working with PlantUML you should install the PlantUML extension to Visual 
Studio Code, which offers a live preview, easy export and some syntax highlighting.
